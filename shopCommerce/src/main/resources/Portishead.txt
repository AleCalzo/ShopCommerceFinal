Portishead is an English band formed in 1991 in Bristol. They are often considered one of the pioneers of trip hop music, although the band themselves have always fiercely disliked the term when used to describe their sound. [7]

The band is named after the nearby town of the same name, eight miles west of Bristol, along the coast.[8] Portishead consists of Beth Gibbons, Geoff Barrow, Adrian Utley, and Jim Barr while sometimes citing a fourth member, Dave McDonald, an engineer on their first records.[9][10]

Their debut album, Dummy, was met with critical acclaim in 1994, quickly becoming a landmark album in the trip hop genre. Two other studio albums have been issued: Portishead in 1997 and Third in 2008, both of which received similar acclaim. In 1998, the band released a concert album, Roseland NYC Live.
